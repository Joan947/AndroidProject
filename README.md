# Nina: An Object and Text Recognition Assistant for Persons with Visual Impairment using Machine Learning
This is an android application that makes use of an image and text classifier to detect and recognize objects and text and in real time using the android phones camera.The results are read out to the user for them to make their decisions after that.The image classifier is applied via a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) trained  using the MobileNets Achitecture. The text classifier was implemented using an optical character recognition algorithms. A text to speech API was added to the project to read out the results to the user instantly and a speech to text algorithm was implemented for the Visually impaired individual to access the features of the application. The images for the project testing results are shown below.
